Tap-to-zap cyber pests before they drain your device! Bug Blasters is a fast 2D arcade game where you protect different devices (Phone â†’ Tablet â†’ Laptop â†’ Desktop â†’ Supercomputer) from waves of black and green bugs. One tap for black, two for green â€” stay sharp as speed and spawns ramp up each level.
